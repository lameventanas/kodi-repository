Once you have installed the repository you'll be able to install all addons and receive automatic updates.


## Install using Kodi's File Manager

The benefit of this method is that you don't need to access Kodi's file system directly.
This is particularly useful when Kodi is running on a TV or another device without easy access.

1. Go to the Kodi File Manager
2. Click "Add source"
3. Use the path `https://siku2.io/kodi-repository/vfs/`. The name doesn't matter.
4. Go to "Add-ons"
5. Select "Install from zip file"
6. Select the source you created in step 3
7. Install "repository.siku2.zip"

You can now remove the file source (You will still receive updates even without it).


## Install manually

1. Download the [repository.siku2.zip]({{ "/vfs/repository.siku2.zip" | relative_url }}) file.
2. Move the file to a location it can be accessed from
3. Go to "Add-ons"
4. Select "Install from zip file"
5. Move to the location you placed the file in step 2
6. Install "repository.siku2.zip"
